# SAMJ
SAMJ implemented with JavaFX (Project for the first Semester)

## Description

This purpose of this project is to have a UI in which you can manage a Oncall Duty plan, which is managed by a telephone system.

In the UI you can create, delete entries or modify them. In the settings you can set the IP and Port of the Server. 

| Telephone number | Start Time | End Time | Forward Number |
|------------------|------------|----------|----------------|
|                  |            |          |                |




# Important for the review 

We merged everything we have already done to DEV. We have a GUI with dummy values, the logic is partly implemented but we did not connect it to the GUI yet. 

In the User interface you can see our values, order them ascending, descending and also search/filter for entries. What needs to be done is the edit mode and settings button and also the settings scene.
